One of the key aspects of putting code onto GitHub is to share it with others,

or to join other projects and then contribute back changes to their repository.

Some key skills for doing so is to make a copy within your account

by forking a repository, and then after making some changes,

you will want to contribute back those changes using the pull request process.

This works both ways, so we will look at also reviewing pull requests,

and finally accepting other's changes into our repository.

Finally, we will synchronize changes from our upstream repository

back to our individual fork or copy of the repository.
